I cannot believe it has been 10 years since Rachel and I met. I don't think anyone will ever be like her again. 

We met at my friend's pool. I had moved back to Denver from Sacramento and was kind of drifting while planning to go to grad school the next fall. I am not sure where my buddy met her, but he brought her back to his pool one day, and we were hanging out. She caught my eye from the begining because, well she looked good in a bikini. But she also had think firey spunk. She is not someone you would really miss in an ordinary situation, but I was also really drawn to her. 

I think at some point we went to the sauna and she burned her hand on the coals a little, which gave me a good chance to play the caring guy. Once the touch barrier was broken it was all over. We probably spent a couple days together the next week then probably saw each other every single day until I moved. Nothing was ever that comfortable that fast.

I never had any fights with Rachel. It was almost impossible. I always tell people that it was because we were never serious enough to run into real disagreements about anything. We didn't live together. We didn't have to share things. But I think that does a disservice to what it really was. We were a perfect fit for a time.
