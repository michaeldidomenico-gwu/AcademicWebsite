I liked Ms. Christiansen. Who knows if that was even her name, but despite that, she was important. Mostly for one thing small thing she said. 

My junior year was mostly fun. My AP European history class went to Italy. I was head over heels for this girl named Alexis. She may have thought of me as the nice boy. Smart. Nothing to worry about. Nothing exciting enough to be interested in. 

She was exciting. She went to raves. But she was also smart. And nice. 

There was a moment in Florence when we were walking down the street. And Ms. Christiansen said something offhand about me being the center of attention I was kind of shocked. I have always been shy and uncomfortable with attention. Every time I would have to give a presentation in front of the class, I would feel the blood rising in my cheeks and would start rushing and panicing. Even when people clapped for me, I assumed it was ironic. Like they were in on a joke and clapped just a bit too much to be for real. So her saying that took me aback.

I never went to talk to teachers outside of class. I did well without seeing them, so I wasn't sure what the point was. But near the end of the year, I was talking to Ms. Christensen in her office. Talk of the Iraq war was everywhere and somehow we began talking about it. I was following the arguments very closely. I read the entire Al Aktadi report and was somewhat pissed off and somewhat unsure about why the neocons were pushing for war when the people who were there looking for nuclear weapons were saying that there was no existential threat. We somehow got to talking about Iraq and I offhand said trying to joke, "Well, there going to bomb a lot of stuff. But who cares. It's only Iraq." To which she immediately responded, "I care." I immediately shrunk back into myself with shame.
